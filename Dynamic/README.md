The program must contain the following functions: 

- Create a window called "My Practical Lab" of fixed size.

- Draw a vertical line in the centre of the window and two circles (a white circle on the left and a black circle on the right) on a grey background.

- Change the background colour to green if the user clicks with the left mouse button on the black circle, and return to the grey background if the user clicks elsewhere.

- Change the background colour to red if the user left-clicks on the white circle.

- Close the window after three clicks with the left mouse button outside the two circles.

- Enable the user to invert the colours of the circles (the white circle becomes black and the black circle becomes white) by right-clicking on one of the circles.
